# Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn to identify patterns and insights that help businesses improve customer retention. The analysis utilizes machine learning techniques and statistical analysis to predict which customers are likely to leave a company or service, based on various factors.

Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

To explore and preprocess customer data.

To identify key factors influencing customer churn.

To build and evaluate machine learning models for churn prediction.

To provide actionable insights for reducing churn.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand customer behavior.

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, and data splitting.

Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluation of models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Model Evaluation Metrics: Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.

Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies the most significant features affecting customer churn.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes customer demographic information, account details, and service usage statistics. Key features may include:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Demographic Details: Age, gender, location, etc.

Account Information: Contract type, tenure, monthly charges, etc.

Service Usage: Internet service, phone service, etc.

Churn: Binary variable indicating if the customer has churned (1) or not (0).
